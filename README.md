## Description
The web app that display the data analysed from log w3c-formatted HTTP access log by the FoxintelligenceApi.

## Things I've done
- Develop an outstanding small React-Redux App
- Implement redux ecosystem
- Add middleware (redux-thunk) to allow async actions
- Connect the to the Api
- Use ReactUI to build the interface

## Things I wish I could have done
- I didn't put too match time on this app , it was just to display data but it's interesting to add more pages and
  take represent more data using charts 
- Implement different tests
- Add realTime aspect to reload the data
- Improve user experience
- Implement cache system using service worker
